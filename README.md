# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
# I decided to create a webpage that is a small directory of Black art that people can use to learn about Black culture and Black Lives Matter.
# The buttons on the homepage are links to other webpages, Youtube videos, and links to organizations that focus on Black issues. The grids below are playlists from different platforms and include mainly conscious rap created by Black artists.
# Music.html is a directory of artists and recommended songs to listen to
# Movies.html are movies and tv shows created by Black artists that either highlight Black issues or celebrate Blackness or just tell the story of Black people in society.
